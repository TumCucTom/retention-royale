# Sample Clash Royale Player Tags
# Replace these with actual player tags you want to analyze
# You can find player tags in-game or from leaderboards

# Example player tags (replace with real ones):
#8L9L9GL
#2L0L0GL  
#9L9L9GL
#2L2L2GL
#8L8L8GL

# To get player tags:
# 1. In Clash Royale, go to a player's profile
# 2. Copy their player tag (starts with #)
# 3. Add it to this file
# 4. Run the data collection script
